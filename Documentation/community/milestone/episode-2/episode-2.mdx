### Episode 2 Milstones

In Episode 2, we're celebrating 4 main milestones that we have achieved as a community since Episode 1.

Here are some of the major product releases and project milestones we're recapping this time:

1. **Milestone 1: sSOL goes liquid** - sSOL is now a liquid token that allows for users to transfer and withdraw on Solayer. This unlocks a ton of utility for depositors who can now participate in DeFi with sSOL.

2. **Milestone 2: Solayer Mainnet Deployment** - We launched our endogenous AVS (endoAVS) system on the Solana mainnet as the first delegation platform live on mainnet. This enabled users to delegate their sSOL to endoAVSs.

3. **Milestone 3: Solayer crosses $200M in TVL** - TVL on Solayer exploded over the past months, blowing past $200M. This Episode also involves our current community in accelerating our growth and reaching our next milestone.

4. **Milestone 4: Exchange-backed LSTs launch on Solayer** - Several exchanges have launched their LSTs and chosen Solayer as the key partner in the launch. Solayer supported deposits for Binance Staked SOL (BNSOL) and Bybit Staked SOL (bbSOL) right out of the gate.

### Episode 2 Explainer

Episode 2 went live at [app.solayer.org/episode2](http://app.solayer.org/episode2) on the Oct 15 and will take place in 2 phases, the Eligibility phase and the Claiming phase.

Episode 2 is where depositors claim their rewards while they interact with Solayer. This includes:

1. Percentile Rank - shows where you stand based on your deposit amount relative to other depositors, such as being in the top 10%.

2. Numerical Rank - numerical rank indicates your exact position among all unique deposit addresses.

3. Extra Credits - extra credits provide boosts based on specific actions, such as delegating to an endoAVS, depositing an exchange-backed LST or using sSOL in DeFi.

4. Referral Credits - referral credits are earned based on how many people joined using your referral link and their deposit amounts.

Episodes capture your contribution to the protocol alongside product milestones. Future Episodes will offer refreshed snapshots for further claims.
