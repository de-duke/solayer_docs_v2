# Introduction to sSOL

**sSOL** is a core component of the **Solayer protocol and Mega Validator**, serving as a **liquid staking token** that represents **Deposited SOL** on the **Solana**. It allows users to **earn staking rewards while maintaining asset liquidity**, enabling seamless participation in **decentralized finance (DeFi) applications**.

<br />

## **Why sSOL?**

By converting **Native SOL and LST SOL to sSOL**, users can:
- **Earn top-tier SOL APY from Mega Validator**—without locking up your assets.
- **Utilize sSOL in DeFi**, maintaining liquidity while securing the network.
- **Enhance dApp scalability** by delegating sSOL, contributing to **network bandwidth and transaction throughput**.
- **Accelerate Solana transactions with Mega Validator.

<br />

## **sSOL as a Universal Liquidity Layer**

sSOL functions as a **universal liquidity layer** within Solayer, supporting:
- **dApps** that require **blockspace and bandwidth allocation**.
- **Liquidity Staking Tokens (LSTs)** that use sSOL liquidity for **efficient capital allocation**.

Each unit of **sSOL represents a unit of blockspace**, meaning it plays a vital role in **optimizing network performance** and **facilitating high TPS (Transactions Per Second) for dApps**.

<br />

## **How to use sSOL**

sSOL holders can use through multiple apps:

### **1. Delegation to endoAVS**
- Users can **delegate sSOL to endoAVS** to help secure **network bandwidth**.
- This process supports **scalability and dApp efficiency** while allowing users to **retain asset flexibility**.

### **2. Participation in DeFi Strategies**
- sSOL holders can **leverage DeFi protocols** to earn additional **APY**.
- Common strategies include:
  - **Providing liquidity** in **DEX AMM pools** to earn **trading fees**.
  - **Depositing in liquidity vaults** to optimize yield and automate liquidity management.

<br />

sSOL serves as both a **staking reward enabler** and a **liquidity-optimizing asset** within the Solayer ecosystem. By combining **staking yield, DeFi integration, and dApp delegation**, sSOL enhances **capital efficiency, network scalability, and liquidity utilization** for **Solana-based applications**.

With its **flexibility and composability**, sSOL unlocks new opportunities for **stakers, DeFi participants, and developers**, making it an essential component of **Solayer’s decentralized infrastructure**.
