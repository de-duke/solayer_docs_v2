The sUSD pool is designed to simplify how users earn yields from T-Bills by providing an on-chain, non-custodial request-for-quote (RFQ) system. 

Instead of juggling multiple platforms and providers, users can access a variety of real-world asset providers through a single, streamlined interface. 

This approach not only distributes risk but also maximizes yield opportunities by leveraging the strengths of different providers. We will also continue to add new RWA partners with time.
