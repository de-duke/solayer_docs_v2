title: "Consensus Scaling"
---

Traditional rollup-based designs rely on **commodity validators** to verify transactions, but **high-throughput verification (1Gb/s) exceeds the capabilities of most nodes**. Posting such data on Layer 1 (L1) is **bandwidth-intensive and costly**. **InfiniSVM** addresses these challenges with a **Proof-of-Authority-and-Stake (PoAS)** model that combines **sequencer-led verification, distributed proof generation, and fallback security on Solana**.

<br />

## **PoAS Consensus Model**

InfiniSVM introduces a **sequencer-driven model** where transactions are **batched into shreds**, each containing:
- **Slot number & transaction vector**  
- **Version metadata for accessed accounts**  
- **Linkage hashes for state continuity**  

Only a **minimal (Effect Hash, Shred Hash) pair** is posted on **Solana**, ensuring **data availability** while avoiding **L1 congestion**.

<br />

## **Transaction Verification & Voting Mechanism**

Upon receiving a **shred**, a **prover** follows a **two-step validation process**:

1. **State Reconstruction & Effect Hash Verification**
   - The prover checks **account versions**.
   - If missing state, the prover **requests shreds** from the sequencer.
   - The prover **re-executes transactions** to derive an **effect hash**.
   - If the computed hash **matches the shredâ€™s embedded effect hash**, the prover **votes for acceptance**.

2. **Majority Vote Finalization**
   - A **51% vote** is required to mark a **shred as finalized**.
   - If all previous shreds are **finalized**, the sequencer **assembles proof** for the block.

<br />

## **Handling Malicious Sequencers & Fault Tolerance**

- **Malicious Proposer Detection**  
  - Honest provers detect invalid transactions via **effect hash mismatches** and **vote against them**.
  - If the sequencer **repeatedly submits invalid shreds**, it is **marked as offline**.
  - Failover to a **backup sequencer** occurs via **PoA voting on Solana**.

- **Censorship Resistance**  
  - If the sequencer **ignores transactions**, users can **force inclusion** by submitting transactions **directly to Solana**.

<br />

## **Efficient Prover Selection & Incentives**

To prevent **hardware-intensive requirements** for provers:
- The sequencer uses a **round-robin method** to select **2/3 of online provers**.
- **Subdivided verification tasks** allow provers to distribute workload across **multiple nodes**.
- **Elastic cloud scaling** allows provers to handle surges in verification demand.

Prover **reward structure**:
- Earn **fees from processed shreds** and **inflationary $LAYER rewards**.
- **Malicious or inactive provers face slashing**:
  - **1st violation**: Loss of epoch fees.
  - **2nd violation**: **1%** slash on staked tokens.
  - **Subsequent violations**: **5%** stake slash per offense.

<br />

The **PoAS model** in **InfiniSVM** achieves:
- **Scalable, high-throughput consensus** without **overloading L1**.
- **Efficient, decentralized validation** via **sequencer-led voting**.
- **Robust security** with **fallback mechanisms on Solana**.

By **optimizing prover participation**, **reducing L1 bandwidth costs**, and **ensuring censorship resistance**, **InfiniSVM** scales consensus while maintaining **decentralization and integrity**.
