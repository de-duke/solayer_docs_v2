# Transaction Semantic Aware Scheduling

The **InfiniSVM** transaction scheduling model extends traditional **account-based partitioning** by incorporating **fine-grained sequence prediction** of **read-write operations**. This approach **reduces lock contention** while maintaining **serializability guarantees**, significantly improving **parallel execution efficiency**.
