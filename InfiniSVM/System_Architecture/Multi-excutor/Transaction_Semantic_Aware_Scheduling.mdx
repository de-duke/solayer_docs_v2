# Transaction Semantic Aware Scheduling

The **SOLAYER CHAIN** transaction scheduling model extends traditional **account-based partitioning** by incorporating **fine-grained sequence prediction** of **read-write operations**. This approach **reduces lock contention** while maintaining **serializability guarantees**, significantly improving **parallel execution efficiency**.

<br />

## **Fine-Grained Execution Tracing & Conflict Resolution**

Unlike traditional schedulers that assume **all account accesses in a transaction conflict**, **SOLAYER CHAIN** constructs an **execution trace** for each transaction **before scheduling**. 

### **Execution Trace Definition**  
For a transaction **t**, we define its execution trace as:
E(t) = {(op1, a1, c1), (op2, a2, c2), …, (opn, an, cn)}

where:
- **opi** ∈ {read, write} represents the **operation type**.
- **ai** represents the **accessed account**.
- **ci** represents the **predicted execution time cost** between operations.

<br />

### **Determining Parallel Execution Feasibility**  
Two transactions **ti** and **tj** can **execute in parallel** if their access patterns satisfy:

1. **No Write-Write Conflicts**:  
   - If transactions access the **same account**, their writes must **not overlap**.

2. **Read-Write Gap Constraint**:  
   - For read **(read, tk) ∈ Sa(ti)** and write **(write, tl) ∈ Sa(tj)** pairs on the same account:
   - The **gap** between operations, **Gk = ck * α**, must satisfy **Gk > δ**, where:
     - **α** is the average **instruction execution time**.
     - **δ** is a **tunable margin** accounting for **estimation errors**.

These conditions allow transactions to be **optimally scheduled in parallel**, reducing **unnecessary locking**.

<br />

## **Optimized Scheduling via Shortest Makespan First (SMF)**

The scheduling problem is **NP-hard** (analogous to **bin-packing**). To ensure sub-millisecond scheduling times, **SOLAYER CHAIN** employs:

- **Shortest Makespan First (SMF)**:  
  - A **greedy scheduling algorithm** commonly used in **database systems**.  
  - Produces a **near-optimal transaction schedule** in real-time.

- **Parallel Scheduler Ensemble**:  
  - Includes **Solana’s account-based partitioning** algorithms as baselines.  
  - Multiple scheduling strategies are explored concurrently.  
  - The schedule with the **least estimated time cost** is selected.

<br />

## **Impact on Performance & Scalability**

By introducing **execution-aware scheduling** and **parallel scheduler ensembles**, SOLAYER CHAIN achieves:
- **Lower lock contention** while maintaining **serializability guarantees**.
- **Higher transaction throughput** through **adaptive, conflict-free execution**.
- **Near-optimal scheduling** in **sub-millisecond latency**.

This **fine-grained, predictive approach** represents a **major advancement** in **high-performance blockchain transaction processing**.
