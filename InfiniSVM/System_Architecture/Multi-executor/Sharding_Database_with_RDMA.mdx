title: "Sharding Database with RDMA"
---

Blockchain systems face significant scalability challenges due to **ever-growing state sizes**. To address this, **InfiniSVM** implements a **sharded key-value store** architecture, integrating **Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)** to enable **ultra-low latency cross-node data access**.

<br />

## **Sharded State Management Architecture**

The **InfiniSVM** database consists of **sharded state storage** across distributed nodes. Unlike **Solanaâ€™s 10MB account size limit**, this system **supports arbitrary account sizes**, dynamically optimizing data distribution.

### **Database Node Components**
Each **database node** consists of three core components:

1. **Jump Table (Memory Indexing)**
   - Maps **32-byte account addresses** to their **memory locations**, data length, and version numbers.
   - Ensures **fast lookups** for state access with **minimal CPU overhead**.

2. **Contiguous Memory Storage**
   - Stores **account state data** along with **synchronization primitives**.
   - **Efficient for most transactions**, as **state size rarely changes**.
   - If state resizing occurs, **data is redistributed during rebalancing** to maintain **contiguous storage**.

3. **Local Cache for Frequently Accessed Data**
   - Implements an **LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy**.
   - Reduces **cross-node fetches** by keeping **hot accounts in memory**.

<br />

## **RDMA-Optimized Cross-Node Data Access**

To enable **efficient cross-node execution**, **SOLAYER CHAIN** utilizes **InfiniBand RDMA**, providing:

- **Ultra-low latency (nanosecond-level) memory access** across nodes.
- **Zero-copy data movement**, bypassing the **operating system overhead**.
- **Reduced CPU load**, offloading memory transfers to **specialized network hardware**.
- **Consistent transaction processing speeds**, even when data is fetched remotely.

By eliminating **traditional network bottlenecks**, RDMA ensures **high-throughput, low-latency execution** across **sharded storage nodes**.

<br />

## **Dynamic Load Balancing & Rebalancing Mechanism**

To maintain **optimal performance**, **InfiniSVM** employs a **background rebalancing mechanism** that:

**Monitors Account Access Patterns**  
   - Analyzes **historical memory access footprints** to identify **high-traffic accounts**.

**Optimizes Data Locality**  
   - Frequently **co-accessed accounts** are migrated to the **same node**.
   - Minimizes **remote memory fetches** and improves **execution efficiency**.

**Adaptive Data Redistribution**  
   - Rebalances data based on:
     - **Access frequency**
     - **Account size**
     - **Network topology**
     - **Node capacity and current load**

This **adaptive approach** ensures **even workload distribution**, reducing **cross-node dependencies** while maximizing **throughput and parallel execution efficiency**.

<br />

By combining **sharded key-value storage** with **RDMA-powered cross-node memory access**, **InfiniSVM** achieves:

- **Scalable, high-performance blockchain state management**.
- **Reduced transaction latency via direct memory access**.
- **Dynamic workload balancing for optimized execution efficiency**.

This architecture **ensures sustainable scalability**, making it well-suited for **high-throughput, decentralized applications**.
