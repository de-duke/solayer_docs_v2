# Solana & SVM

This document provides an overview of **Solana**’s architecture and its **Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)**. It is intended as background material for understanding how high-performance, parallelized blockchain systems can leverage specialized hardware and low-latency networks.

## Solana

Solana is a high-performance blockchain that introduces several innovations to achieve low-latency, high-throughput transaction processing. Its core design principles include:

**Proof of History (PoH)**  
   - PoH acts as a cryptographic clock for the network. Rather than simply relying on block production timestamps, each validator produces a chain of hashed data, creating a verifiable record of time elapsed between events.  
   - This approach reduces the coordination overhead among validators and allows Solana to pipeline transaction processing stages.

**Proof of Stake (PoS) Consensus**  
   - Solana uses a variant of Proof of Stake, where validators stake SOL tokens to participate in block production and earn rewards for honest validation.  
   - Slashing conditions penalize misbehaving or inactive validators, thereby securing the network.

**Turbine Protocol for Block Propagation**  
   - Solana breaks down blocks into smaller data packets (shreds) and rapidly distributes them to validators through a multicast-like approach.  
   - The Turbine layer ensures data is propagated in a bandwidth-efficient way to reduce latency across geographically distributed validators.

**Pipelining**  
   - Solana processes transactions in a pipeline to fully utilize CPU resources. This pipeline is broken into distinct stages (e.g., Fetch, SigVerify, Banking) that can work in parallel, allowing the system to handle more transactions concurrently.

**Sealevel Execution Environment**  
   - The Sealevel runtime executes transactions in parallel by analyzing which accounts they read or write. Transactions specifying non-overlapping accounts can run simultaneously across multiple CPU cores.  
   - This is the key enabler of Solana’s high transaction throughput.

Through these design choices, Solana aims to provide a **single global state machine** capable of extremely high TPS (Transactions per Second), typically in the thousands or tens of thousands, with minimal transaction fees.

## Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)

The **Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)** is at the heart of Solana’s on-chain execution. It departs from the traditional EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) model by emphasizing:

**Shared-Nothing Concurrency**  
   - Each transaction declares upfront which accounts it will read or write.  
   - The runtime schedules transactions so that non-overlapping account operations run in parallel. Conflicting transactions are serialized, ensuring no double-spend or inconsistent state updates.

**Pessimistic Concurrency Control**  
   - By declaring accounts in advance, the SVM knows exactly which data a transaction will touch before execution.  
   - This contrasts with many EVM designs, which often rely on optimistic concurrency (i.e., detect conflicts at runtime and roll back if necessary). The SVM approach avoids expensive rollbacks by preventing conflicts from executing in parallel in the first place.

**Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)**  
   - The SVM implements an MVCC-like model, storing multiple versions of data to handle concurrent reads without blocking writes on popular accounts.  
   - Write operations are strictly ordered, typically dictated by Solana’s PoH sequence, ensuring a deterministic final state.

**eBPF Execution**  
   - Programs deployed on Solana run inside an extended BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) environment.  
   - The eBPF-based runtime is optimized for safety and speed, allowing the blockchain to validate and execute smart contracts at near-native performance.

**Account-based Programming Model**  
   - SVM uses an account-based model where each account can hold data of arbitrary size and remain mutable across transactions.  
   - By analyzing account read/write sets, Solana’s validator software can pipeline and parallelize transactions more effectively.

Because of these features, the SVM can attain significant throughput gains and lower latency compared to many other blockchain virtual machines. In practice, this architecture has enabled Solana to host a variety of high-performance DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, and gaming dApps, all sharing a unified global state with strong composability.
