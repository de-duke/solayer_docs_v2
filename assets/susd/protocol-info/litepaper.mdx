## Solayer USD: Yield-bearing Real World Assets Backed Synthetic Stablecoin

Here you can access the [sUSD litepaper](https://github.com/SolayerDev/solayer_docs/blob/main/susd/sUSD-litepaper.pdf), which provides detailed information about sUSD and its unique features.

## Abstract

This paper introduces Solayer USD (sUSD), a pioneering dollar-pegged stablecoin backed by a basket of low risk profiled real world assets (RWAs), such as U.S. Treasury Bills, Bond, Gold etc, offering a secure 4-5% annual yield to holders through T-Bill-backed interest accrual initially. Utilizing Solana’s Token2022 extension [[Sol24]](https://spl.solana.com/token-2022/extensions), sUSD’s innovative protocol adjusts balance multi- pliers instead of token amounts, allowing holders to realize yield growth seamlessly. Additionally, through a decentralized request-for-quote (RFQ) protocol, users’ assets are diversified into var- ious liquidity providers through matching engines, streamlining subscriptions and redemptions. Beyond basic yield through RWAs, sUSD can be delegated to modular AVSs, enabling holders to participate in the security of decentralized systems while earning additional returns. A focus on transparency, on-chain verifiability, and rigorous security measures ensures that sUSD main- tains stability, security, and a reliable peg. Through Solayer USD, the Solana ecosystem advances toward a decentralized, bankless economy that redefines stablecoin utility and liquidity.

## Audits

Contract security is core to Solayer’s long-haul commitment to building secure and scalable crypto-economic infrastructure. Here is the latest audits for the sUSD program:
