title: "Epoch 1"

<Info>
  Epoch 1 of the Solayer launch continued the momentum built during Epoch 0, opening the doors to a broader audience and increasing the opportunities for participation.
</Info>

Started on May 27th, Epoch 1 had a total value locked (TVL) cap of 50 million USD. This stage saw a significant increase in total depositors, reaching over 9,000 from Epoch 0 to the end of Epoch 1. As of 15.06.2024, there are about $50 million locked.

Unlike Epoch 0, there was no time limit imposed on Epoch 1, allowing participants ample time to engage with the pool. However, native SOL deposits were prioritized to ensure the stability and growth of the platform. Withdrawals will be enabled starting at Epoch 3, providing participants with flexibility in managing their investments.

## Permanent Referral Link

Participants who deposited 10 native SOL received a permanent referral link, granting them a significant advantage. Through this link, they could earn 10% of their referees' rewards, enhancing their potential earnings. Itâ€™s important to note that one-time use codes are disabled post Epoch 1, making the permanent referral link an exclusive benefit.
