sSOL allows users to tap into one of the best performing hardware accelerated and MEV-powered validators on Solana. We're able to maximize the value returned back to sSOL holders by providing:

 - 0% Commission
 - 100% MEV kickback
 - Rebating leader block rewards back to the stake pool
 - Dedicated hardware
 - Codebase optimizations

sSOL APY figures are calculated based on a least squares linear regression on the sSOL redemption rate from the last 4 epochs. At each epoch, the ratio between sSOL and SOL in the Solayer Stake Pool is taken, and a gradient is calculated from the change in redemption rate.
