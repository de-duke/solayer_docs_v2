title: "Delegation"
---

The Solayer stake delegation process is straightforward:

1. Conversion: Users convert SOL into sSOL.
2. Delegation: SOL is delegated to Solayer-recommended validators, which then delegate it to an Delegate dApp (endogenous AVS) on Solayer, converting sSOL to a delegated form.
3. Minting Tokens: Solayer dApps mint Delegate Tokens, which serve as stake proof to retrieve SOL and claim rewards.
