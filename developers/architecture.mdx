Solayer's architecture is designed to provide a robust, flexible, and scalable infrastructure solutions on the Solana blockchain. This document outlines the key components and processes that form the foundation of our protocol, offering insights into how Solayer manages assets, delegates stake, and handles rewards.

## Pool Manager

The pool manager is the core component overseeing asset flow into the protocol. Its key functions include:

- Processing user deposits of LST or SOL
- Converting SOL to sSOL-raw
- Issuing fungible token representations (Solayer assets)

Currently, these Solayer assets are illiquid to facilitate points calculation for the liquidity reward program. Future iterations will introduce liquidity to enhance DeFi composability.

## Unbonding and Delegation

- Solayer assets have no unbonding lockups at the base layer
- AVS unbonding is managed separately by the delegation manager
- AVSs can design custom unbonding processes (max 2-day period)
- Emergency exit mechanism available for AVS failures

## Protocol Development Stages

### Stage 1: Current Implementation

- Focus on asset intake and conversion
- Rewards accounting and distribution

### Stage 2: Enhanced Functionality

- Users can pledge Solayer assets to secure blockspace for decentralized applications on Solana
- Users construct portfolios by selecting specific delegates

## Rewards and Accounting

- Offline calculation of rewards
- State watcher implementation for tracking deposits and withdrawals
- Real-time application of additional rewards based on invite relationships

This architecture provides a robust foundation for Solayer's ecosystem, balancing security, flexibility, and future expandability.
