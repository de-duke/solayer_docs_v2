### Episode 1 Explainer

Episode 1 went live at [app.solayer.org/valley](http://app.solayer.org/valley) on the July 2nd, alongside Epoch 3.

Episode 1 is where depositors claim their rewards in conjunction with deposits. This includes:

1. Percentile Rankings - percentile ranking shows where you stand based on your deposit amount, such as being in the top 10%.

2. Numerical Ranks - numerical rank indicates your position among all unique deposit addresses.

3. Extra Credits - extra credits provide boosts based on specific actions, such as Epoch 0 and Epoch 1 participation, as well as basic LST and native SOL boost.

4. Referral Points - referral points are earned based on how many people joined using your referral link and their deposit amounts.

Episodes capture your contribution to the protocol alongside product milestones. Future Episodes will offer refreshed snapshots for further claims.

Concurrently, Epoch 3 is live for eligibility checks, and withdrawals will be enabled after EP 1 claims are completed to avoid accounting errors.

More information on withdrawals will be provided soon.
