Solayer is a hardware-accelerated blockchain network designed for high throughput and near-zero latency. 

Built on InfiniBand technology, SDN, RDMA, and a multi-executor model, Solayer’s primary goal is to scale the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) while providing enhanced capabilities for securing block space and prioritizing transaction inclusion.

# 1,000,000 TPS

InfiniSVM is an infinitely scalable, hardware-accelerated blockchain capable of reaching unprecedented throughput. 

It is designed to handle **1,000,000 TPS** - **1 Million** Transactions Per Second (TPS).  

Software scaling has reached its limit due to bandwidth constraints and the single-threaded execution model. 
The next era of blockchain scaling will be driven by horizontal scaling and hardware offloading.  



**InfiniSVM** stands as the fastest production blockchain.
