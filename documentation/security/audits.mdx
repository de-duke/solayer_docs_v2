Despite having thorough security reviews, we encourage community members, technical hackers, and researchers to comprehensively review the contracts, and report to [`report@solayer.org`](mailto:report@solayer.org), or via proper channels if any bugs have been identified.

Lastly, Solayer will conduct two audits per year on all existing contracts.
