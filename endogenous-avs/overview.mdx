Solayer is a blockchain scaling platform built on the highly performant SVM. Our architecture is uniquely designed to support on-chain decentralized applications (dApps), which we refer to as endogenous Actively Validated Services (AVSs).

Unlike traditional platforms that primarily focus on exogenous AVSs (such as oracles and bridges), Solayer's initial emphasis is on enhancing the capabilities of native Solana dApps. Our system architecture aims to provide these dApps with:

1. Increased probability of securing block space
2. Prioritized transaction inclusion

This approach allows developers to create more responsive and efficient applications within the Solana ecosystem, leveraging Solayer's innovative stake-weighted quality of service mechanisms.
