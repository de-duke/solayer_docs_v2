title: What is an AVS?
---


Solayer introduces a novel concept in blockchain infrastructure: a system where decentralized applications (dApps) can dynamically allocate their processing power based on staked tokens. This stake-weighted approach allows dApps to influence network operations proportionally to their stake, resulting in faster and more reliable user transactions.

## Solayer's Trustless Marketplace

At its core, Solayer is creating a trustless marketplace with the following key features:

1. **Delegation Management**: dApps can manage and collect staked tokens from users.
2. **Stake-weighted Quality of Service**: Transaction inclusion is based on validator delegations.
3. **Native Solana Focus**: Unlike systems like EigenLayer that prioritize external services, Solayer focuses on native Solana dApps.

## Endogenous AVSs (Actively Validated Services)

Solayer introduces the concept of endogenous AVSs, which are native Solana dApps that can:

- Secure necessary block space
- Prioritize transactions based on delegated tokens

## Technical Implementation: Stake-weighted Quality of Service (swQoS)

The core technical feature enabling this system is Stake-weighted Quality of Service (swQoS). This mechanism allows dApps to:

1. Reserve blockchain space and processing power
2. Enhance network efficiency and reliability

For a detailed explanation of swQoS, refer to our [quality-of-service documentation](quality-of-service.md).

By leveraging Solayer's architecture, developers can create more efficient and responsive dApps on the Solana blockchain, benefiting from proportional resource allocation without incurring additional fees.
