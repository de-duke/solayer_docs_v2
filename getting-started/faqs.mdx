## Introduction

<Accordion title="What is Solayer?">
  Solayer is the hardware-accelerated SVM L1 blockchain to support high throughput, near zero-latency use cases with 1M+ TPS and 100+ Gbps network bandwidth. The InfiniSVM infinitely scales the SVM through a multi-executor model, dedicated InfiniBand technology, SDN and RDMA.  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why should I use Solayer?">
  Solayer enhances the user experience on Solana by expanding network bandwidth through endoAVS delegations, while providing one of the best performing validator infrastructure on the market.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I get started with Solayer?">
  a) Read the docs (https://docs.solayer.org). This may be the most important thing to understand what Solayer is about, and how one can interact with it. Then, don’t hesitate to ask any questions on the Solayer Discord server.

  b) If you are completely new to Solana, check our Solayer 101 Academy and start learning from scratch. (Coming soon to our Discord - discord.com/invite/solayerlabs)

## Delegation 

<Accordion title="What is sSOL?">
sSOL is a liquid token on Solayer that unlocks a range of DeFi use cases such as liquidity provisioning, collateral, and spot trading.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does the delegation process work on Solayer?">
The delegation process involves three steps:
1. Conversion: Users deposit native SOL to receive sSOL.
2. Delegation: SOL is delegated to Solayer-recommended validators, which then delegate it to Delegates (dApps) on Solayer, converting sSOL to a delegated form.
3. Minting Tokens: Delegates mint delegated sSOL tokens, which serve as stake proof to retrieve staked SOL and claim rewards.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are Delegates in the Solayer ecosystem?">
Delegates are endogenous Actively Validated Services (AVSs), which are essentially dApps built on Solana. They can receive delegations of sSOL to secure network bandwidth and transaction throughput.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is stake-weighted quality of service (swQoS)?">
Stake-weighted quality of service (swQoS) allocates network resources, like block space and transaction processing, based on the delegations committed by delegators. The more delegations allocated for a dApp's RPC, the higher the quality of service it will receive.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="What benefits do users get from delegating on Solayer?">
Users can earn native yields through MEV-boost and APY from delegates. They can also support their favorite Solana dApps by delegating assets towards them.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What types of tokens can be deposited on Solayer?">
Currently, Solayer supports the following tokens for deposits:
* SOL (Solana Native Staking)
* mSOL (Marinade Staked SOL)
* INF (Infinity)
* JitoSOL (JitoSOL)
* bSOL (BlazeStake Staked SOL)
