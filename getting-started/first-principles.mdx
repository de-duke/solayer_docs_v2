We are not first-time builders in crypto. We also did not get into crypto for the hype. We were in this space when no one knew what it was.

Product-Market Fit is not a commonly used metric for crypto products, which are very much narrative-driven just like any novel technological darling. Yes, absolutely, we need to capture the narrative, but there were a few strategic decisions we made to ensure the product outlasts the narrative.

PoS validator infrastructure has unchallenged PMF, so in addition to delegations, our 1st layer infrastructure covers everything Marinade or Jito has built â€” a highly performant sSOL with MEV-boosted yield. Unlike EigenLayer, which does not have liquid staking, it does generate revenue. Solana only has about 4B USD in SOL staked, and the opportunity is an 80B USD market.

We did not fundamentally agree with EigenLayer's technical architecture. So we re-architected, in a sense, restandardized delegations in the Solana ecosystem - reusing SOL as a way of securing network bandwidth for apps. We aim to become the de facto infrastructure for stake-weighted quality of service, and eventually, a core primitive of the Solana blockchain/consensus.
