description: 'Solayer is the hardware accelerated SVM blockchain.'
---


Solayer is the hardware accelerated SVM blockchain, designed for high throughput, near-zero latency blockchain, powered by InfiniBand technology, SDN, RDMA and a multi-executor model.

Our primary goal is to scale the SVM while providing increased capabilities for securing block space and prioritizing transaction inclusion.


## Core Components

Solayer's architecture comprises two main approaches:

### Solana swQoS Architecture
The delegation component of Solayer includes:

- Pool Manager: Oversees asset flow and conversion into Solayer-specific tokens (e.g., sSOL).
- Delegation Manager: Handles stake distribution across validators and AVSs.
- Stake Pool: Manages validator selection and MEV-boosted returns.

### Technical Integration
For developers and integration partners, Solayer offers:

- CLI: A command-line interface for interacting with Solayer (endoAVS and deposits)
- API Documentation: Comprehensive guides for interacting with Solayer contracts.
- Smart Contract Interfaces: Well-defined interfaces for building compatible dApps.


## Usage

To get started with Solayer, you can either use Ledger or Phantom wallet. You can find more detailed instructions below.
