title: "Scaling Transaction Processing"
---

The **InfiniSVM** transaction processing architecture is designed for **high throughput and low-latency execution**. It employs a **multi-stage pipeline** that optimizes transaction verification, execution, and state updates using **parallel processing, RDMA, and FPGA acceleration**.

<br />

## **Transaction Processing Pipeline**

Each transaction follows a structured pipeline to ensure **efficient execution and consistency**:

1. **Ingress & Verification**
   - Transactions enter the network via an **initial ingress point**.
   - **Signature verification (sigverify)** and **local deduplication** are performed to filter redundant transactions.

2. **Pre-Execution**
   - Transactions undergo **pre-execution** to determine their **state dependencies**.
   - **Intermediate transaction effects and snapshots** are sent to the **sequencer** via **InfiniBand** for efficient state tracking.

3. **Sequencer & Execution Path Selection**
   - The **sequencer**, utilizing an **SDN switch and FPGA acceleration**, determines execution paths:
     - **Simple Path**: If all accounts involved are at their **latest state**, the transaction **bypasses additional validation**.
     - **Complex Path**: If at least one account has a **newer version**, the transaction enters a **local mempool** for **ordering and re-execution**.

4. **Parallel Execution & State Updates**
   - **RDMA** applies **state changes directly** for **simple path transactions**, leveraging a **local cache on the SDN switch**.
   - **Complex path transactions** are **scheduled** in the **local mempool**, ensuring **fairness and optimal parallel execution**.

5. **Finalization & Propagation**
   - Once execution is complete and **state changes are committed**, the transaction is **broadcast globally** through a **Proof of Propagation (PoPs) network**.

<br />

## **Optimized Scheduling & State Storage**

To achieve **sub-millisecond processing speeds**, the sequencer:
- Implements an **optimized scheduling algorithm** to parallelize **dependent transactions**.
- Stores account data in a **distributed database**, ensuring **scalability and data integrity**.

<br />

The **InfiniSVM** architecture integrates **SDN, RDMA, and FPGA-accelerated sequencing** to enable **high-performance transaction processing**. By **intelligently routing transactions through simple or complex paths**, it minimizes **latency** while maximizing **parallel execution efficiency**.
