title: What is sSOL?
---

sSOL is the universal liquidity layer for delegates [dApps] and LRTs on Solayer. Every unit of SOL can be perceived as a unit of blockspace lent towards dApps, securing network bandwidth and TPS.

The delegation towards dApps, which derives an AVS SPL token, is built on top of sSOL-SOL liquidity. Similarly, LRTs are built on top of sSOL liquidity interface to generate vault strategies.

There are various ways of utilizing sSOL and earning maximum yield as an sSOL holder:

1. Delegate to dApps to bootstrap network bandwidth
2. Participate in DeFi strategies to earn additional APY, starting with our launch partners

By leveraging sSOL, users can maximize their yield while contributing to the Solayer ecosystem's growth and stability.
