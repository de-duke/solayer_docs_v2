**Redemption Process:**
<Steps>
<Step title="User Sends Back sUSD to Kickoff Withdrawal:">
    The user sends back sUSD to the Solayer sUSD Program to initiate the withdrawal process. This action signals the start of the withdrawal procedure.
</Step>
<Step title="Protocol Calculates and Sends Wrapped T-Bill:">
    The Solayer sUSD Program calculates the corresponding amount of wrapped T-Bill that needs to be redeemed based on the user's withdrawal request. The wrapped T-Bill is then forwarded to the Decentralized T-Bill RFQ Protocol.
</Step>
<Step title="Qualified Liquidity Provider Fulfills the Withdrawal Order:">
    The Qualified Liquidity Provider receives the wrapped T-Bill and fulfills the withdrawal order. This involves transferring out the wrapped T-Bill and sending the equivalent amount of USDC back to the protocol.
</Step>
<Step title="USDC Returned to the User:">
    After the liquidity provider fulfills the withdrawal order, the decentralized protocol returns the corresponding amount of USDC to the user, completing the withdrawal process.
</Step>
