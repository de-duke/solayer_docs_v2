## Cost Structure
 - **User-Defined Commission:** Users set their preferred commission rate (e.g., 1 basis point).
 - **Incentive for Market Makers:** The commission incentivizes market makers to participate and compete for orders.
 - **Impact of Commission:** Higher commissions can lead to faster order fulfillment but at a slightly higher cost to the user.
 - **Transaction Fees:** The transaction fee will be imposed during the redemption process (paid in USDC). This fee is computed on-chain and will be floated to the Investment Manager's treasury address.
