**Subscription Process:**
<Steps>
<Step title="User Locks USDC:">
    The user locks USDC to initiate a transaction. This action creates a quote that specifies the amount of USDC, the expiry time, and the commission rate for the trade.
</Step>
<Step title="Fulfillment by Qualified Liquidity Provider (Buy Order):">
    The qualified liquidity provider fulfills the buy order by transferring the USDC out and sending back a wrapped T-Bill (tokenized representation of a T-Bill) as proof.
</Step>
<Step title="Forwarding Wrapped T-Bill:">
    The decentralized T-Bill RFQ (Request for Quote) protocol forwards it to the sUSD minting program, locking it there in the process.
</Step>
<Step title="Minting sUSD:">
    The Solayer sUSD Program mints sUSD based on the value of the wrapped T-Bill, maintaining a 1:1 price peg with USDC.
</Step>
<Step title="Delegate sUSD to Secure Exogenous AVS (Coming Soon):">
    The user can delegate sUSD to secure our exogenous AVSs (exoAVSs) when it goes live.
</Step>
</Steps>
